# Shooting-Robot-Arduino-Code
I had written the codes for a microprocessor, which will be using on a moving robot that is designed to shoot Ping-pong ball as a basketball simulation.

There are two files in this section:
- Arduino Code for PS4 Controller (A PS4 controller will be connected to ESP32 via bluetooth for controlling the robot)
- Arduino Code for IOT (A HTML website will be hosted via ESP32 on local network for controlling the robot)
